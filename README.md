# RecFusion

This is the official code for the paper `RecFusion: A Binomial Diffusion Process for 1D Data
for Recommendation`


To run the code, you can use `train.py`. 

For hyperparameter tuning, we provide `recfusion hyperopt.ipynb` and for parallel execution `recfusion parallel exec.ipynb`. In both cases, we assume a spark cluster is already setup (in our case in Databricks).
